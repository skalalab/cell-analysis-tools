  * Differential box counting and shift differential box counting algorithm for calculating fractal dimension of grayscale images

# binary box counting method 
* Code is at https://gist.github.com/rougier/e5eafc276a4e54f516ed5559df4242c0
  * You'll need a Sierpinski image to test, I attached the one I use below.
